This is in 'Minimum Lovable Prototype' Phase of development, so please be gentle!
/Exampledata contains the properly stored Rawdata as well as the Testplanv2 formatted document, please review these and maintain the directory format to ensure no errors result.
The TestPlan format is critical to properly propigating the test information into the calculations and report generation. 
Errors and unexpected behaviors will result if the Testplanv2 format is not followed
